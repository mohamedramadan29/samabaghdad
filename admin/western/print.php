Some locations are open hours Regular money transfers are usually available within minutes for pick up by the receiver, subject to the opening hours of the receiving Western Union Agent("Agent")location. The Next Day/ Day and account-based money transfer services are available upon request to limited countries. The money sent using the Next Day/ Day money transfer service will be available for collection after and hours respectively. Account-based transfers generally take business days, though transfers to mobile wallets are often available within minutes. Delays and other restrictions apply in certain countries.

                            Money transfers will normally be paid in cash, but some Agents will pay by cheque or a combination of cash and cheque or may offer or the receiver may choose other ways to receive funds and some money transfers may be paid to accounts. All cash payments are subject to availability, receivers showing documentary evidence of their identity and providing all details about the money transfer required by Western Union, including sender's and receiver's names, country of origin, approximate sum and any other conditions or requirements applicable at the Agent location, for example the money transfer control number, which is mandatory for payout in some countries. The sender authorizes Western Union to honor the receiver's choice of method to receive funds even if it differs from the sender's. Cash money transfers shall be paid to the person that Agents deem entitled to receive the transaction after verification of identity often through examination of identification documents. Such payment can be made even when the form filled out by the receiver contains errors. Neither Western Union nor its Agents carry out a comparison of the "To Send Money" form against the "To Receive Money" form to verify the address given for the receiver. In some destinations the receiver may be required to provide identification, a test question answer or both to receive funds i Ã  cash. Test questions are not an additional security feature and cannot be used to time or delay the payment of
                            a transaction and are prohibited in certain countries. Applicable law prohibits money transmitters from doing business with certain individuals and countries.
